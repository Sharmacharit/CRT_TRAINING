Campus Recruitment Training 📘

Welcome to my Campus Recruitment Training repository!

This repo contains everything I learned during the training sessions at my college, focused mainly on Data Structures and Algorithms (DSA). It covers DSA topics from the very basics to advanced (pro) level.

📚 What You'll Find Here
Basic concepts of DSA (like arrays, strings, and recursion)

Important data structures (linked lists, stacks, queues, trees, graphs, etc.)

Searching and sorting algorithms

Advanced topics (dynamic programming, backtracking, greedy algorithms, etc.)

Coding problems and solutions

Tips and tricks for campus placements

🎯 Purpose of This Repo
I created this repository to:

Keep all my training notes and practice code in one place

Revise important DSA concepts anytime

Help others preparing for campus placements or learning DSA

🚀 How to Use
Feel free to go through the folders and files. Each topic is explained with code and examples (wherever possible). You can also clone the repo and practice the problems yourself.
